**Injektr** is a free, open-source mobile app to help GLP-1 users (like those on Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, etc.) track their injections, side effects, and health trends. Built with love in Flutter.

No bullshit. No bloat. Just clean data tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- Track injection doses & times
- Log side effects with severity
- Monitor trends and analytics
- Schedule reminders
- Switch between Light, Dark, and OLED Black themes
- Fully offline with optional export
- No ads. No data mining. Ever.

## 🧠 Why?

People deserve better tools for their health—especially tools that _don’t_ harvest your data or upsell subscriptions.

## 📱 Platforms

- Android
- iOS
